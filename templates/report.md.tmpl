## Scoring Methodology

PerfGuard calculates a performance score from 0 to 100:

- **Starting score:** 100
- **Critical finding:** -25 points (scaled by file count)
- **High finding:** -10 points (scaled by file count)
- **Medium finding:** -4 points (scaled by file count)
- **Low finding:** -1 point (scaled by file count)

**Grades:**

| Grade | Score Range |
|-------|-------------|
| A | 90 -- 100 |
| B | 80 -- 89 |
| C | 70 -- 79 |
| D | 60 -- 69 |
| F | 0 -- 59 |

## Anti-Pattern Categories

| Category | What It Detects |
|----------|----------------|
| **Database / ORM** | N+1 queries, SELECT *, missing eager loading, unbounded queries, SQL concatenation |
| **JavaScript / TypeScript** | await in loops, sync I/O, missing Promise.all, memory leaks, full lodash imports |
| **Python** | sleep in async, sync I/O in async, string concat loops, missing connection pools |
| **General** | unbounded retries, missing timeouts, polling patterns, missing caching |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix critical issues immediately** -- these cause measurable latency and resource waste
2. **Address high-severity findings** before the next deployment
3. **Plan medium-severity fixes** for upcoming sprints
4. **Review low-severity items** for best-practice improvements
5. **Re-run the scan** after fixes to verify improvements: `perfguard scan`
6. **Install pre-commit hooks** to prevent regressions: `perfguard hooks install`
7. **Set up performance budgets** for CI/CD gates: `perfguard budget`
